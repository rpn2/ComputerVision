Image Demosaicing

Step 1: Construct "mosaic" of an image according to Standard Bayer pattern

Step 2: Demosaic the image using simple linear interpolation, averaging neighboring pixel values. Compute mean square error between reconstructed image and original image

Step3: Improved interpolation using Freeman's method. Compute mean square error between reconstructed image and original image
